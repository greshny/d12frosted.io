<p>In my opinion, <a href="https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/">org-roam</a> is among the best things that happened to Emacs during the last 5 years. Forget Zettelkasten method, <code class="verbatim">org-roam</code> is a solution for non-hierarchical note-taking regardless of methodology you are worshiping. The most important and appealing feature of <code class="verbatim">org-roam</code> is its database! Just imagine, in less than a second I can filter a collection of 10000+ notes by tags, title, aliases, links and other things. This is what made my <a href="https://github.com/d12frosted/vino">wine tracking</a> solution usable with ever growing collection of tasting notes, and this is what I used to build various tools for presenting non-trivial views around my notes (<a href="https://github.com/d12frosted/environment/blob/master/emacs/README.org#managing-litnotes">example of a public one</a>).</p>
<p>And now <code class="verbatim">org-roam</code> has <a href="https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/releases/tag/v2.0.0">released</a> <code class="verbatim">V2</code>, the first major redesign affecting both users and authors of libraries extending <code class="verbatim">org-roam</code>. And while there are breaking changes requiring some effort from users, <code class="verbatim">V2</code> is so amazing and is so much more stable than <code class="verbatim">V1</code>, that my advice is to drop the chains of old <code class="verbatim">org-roam</code> and embrace all the goodness <code class="verbatim">V2</code> brings.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, major redesign means lots of breaking changes and in this post I am going to describe my migration experience, code I used to migrate my notes and share some thoughts after migrating a code base comparable to <code class="verbatim">org-roam</code> itself. Of course, it touches my precious <a href="https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea">vulpea</a> library (the fox image is its icon), so expect some advertisement™.</p>
<p>NB. Migration process means adapting to and overcoming breaking changes. Since <code class="verbatim">V2</code> is full of them, this article might look pessimistic or depressing. But don’t get fooled, I think that <code class="verbatim">V2</code> is amazing. I am very happy to use it on a daily basis for several months and I never looked back. <a href="https://github.com/jethrokuan">Jethro</a> is doing amazing work! As well as all <a href="https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/graphs/contributors">contributors</a> (with extra kudos to <a href="https://github.com/nobiot">Noboru Ota</a>, because Noboru rocks).</p>

<p>Please note that the goal is not to discuss GTD or any other methodology, but rather to discover how org-roam combined with everything we talked previously may help you to improve your capturing process regardless of methodology you are using.</p>

      <p><strong>TL;DR</strong> This post describes an approach to make byte compiler and various linters happy and <strong>useful</strong> in your <code class="verbatim">.emacs.d</code>, while maintaining startup performance, the ability to write embedded packages and test them. This is going to be a long post, so grab a bottle of wine, snacks and follow me.

<hr />

<p>The longest project in my life is <a href="https://github.com/d12frosted/environment">environment</a>, it started with <a href="https://github.com/d12frosted/environment/tree/master/emacs">Emacs configurations</a> - personal frustration and my biggest time <del>waster</del> investment. I might be masochistic, but I never felt sorry for falling into this <del>trap</del> world. And boy, sometimes it is painful to maintain something in this ever-mutating and dynamic system.</p>
<p>There are various tools to help maintaining Emacs package, all fall into one of four categories - project management tools (e.g. <a href="https://cask.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Cask</a>, <a href="https://github.com/doublep/eldev/">doublep/eldev</a>, <a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/makem.sh">alphapapa/makem.sh</a>), compiler (e.g. built-in byte compiler), linters (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/purcell/package-lint">purcell/package-lint</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mattiase/relint">mattiase/relint</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gonewest818/elisp-lint/">gonewest818/elisp-lint</a>, <a href="https://github.com/emacs-elsa/Elsa">emacs-elsa/Elsa</a>) and test frameworks (e.g. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/ert/index.html">ERT</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/emacs-buttercup">jorgenschaefer/emacs-buttercup</a>). The tricky part comes when you want to use them for maintaining your own Emacs configurations, as they have different requirements compared to regular Emacs packages. At least in my case, they do.</p>
<p>First of all, I want Emacs to start as quickly as possible (e.g. in less than a second), meaning that I need to use tools like <code class="verbatim">use-package</code> for deferred loading. So I can’t <code class="verbatim">require</code> most of the packages directly except those that are used in the bootstrapping process. This easily makes compiler sad.</p>
<p>Secondly, I have lots of additional functions extending or combining functionality of one or more packages. But I hate to define them inside <code class="verbatim">use-packge</code> macro. Aside from aesthetics, I want to retain functionality of <code class="verbatim">xref-find-definitions</code>. Having definitions outside of <code class="verbatim">use-package</code> means that I will get many false byte compiler warnings and errors. Which is not helpful!</p>
<p>Thirdly, bootstrap process is different as project management tools isolate your package development from your Emacs configurations, which makes sense in general, but doesn’t make sense when you develop the aforementioned configurations.</p>
<p>The closest approach I know about is <a href="https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs">hlissner/doom-emacs</a>, but even there <code class="verbatim">.emacs.d</code> is <a href="https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/46dedb3e3361535052d199e994b641dca2c2cffd/modules/lang/emacs-lisp/config.el#L14">ignored</a> by compiler. Let me just quote a docstring from there:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This checker (flycheck) tends to produce a lot of false positives in your .emacs.d and private config, so it is mostly useless there. However, special hacks are employed so that flycheck still does <strong>some</strong> helpful linting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it’s Emacs, right? Everything is possible! So let’s find a way to make byte compiler and linters helpful and enable testing of Emacs configurations.</p>

      <p>We all know, network is unreliable. I love those moments when I decide to upgrade all my Emacs packages while connected via 3G. And since I am using <a href="https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el/">raxod502/straight.el</a>, the process requires to process each repository one by one. Now imagine my frustration, when due to unstable connection it fails on one of the repositories and I need to start the process again… from the beginning.</p>
<p>So I say, no more, <a href="https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el/">raxod502/straight.el</a> should retry read operations over network! Unfortunately, there is no such option out of box (or at least I could not find it). Luckily, it’s Emacs!</p>

Then, in <a href="https://d12frosted.io/posts/2020-07-07-task-management-with-roam-vol4.html">Vol 4</a> we talked about automatic tagging of tasks whenever a person is mentioned either in the title or the body of some task. This all makes <code class="verbatim">org-agenda</code> <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Matching-tags-and-properties.html#Matching-tags-and-properties">matching capabilities</a> really useful for when we want to see the list of all tasks related to specific person.</p>

This relied upon adding all <code class="verbatim">org-roam</code> files to <code class="verbatim">org-agenda-files</code>, which doesn’t scale well, as when you build an agenda buffer, it needs to traverse each file. Once you have more than 1k notes, things become sluggish.</p>
<p>In my experience, once I reached 1200 note files, <code class="verbatim">org-agenda</code> constantly took more than 50 seconds to build, rendering this tool completely useless. But then I realised that only 3% of those files actually contain any <code class="verbatim">TODO</code> entries, so there is no need to traverse whole <code class="verbatim">org-roam-directory</code>!</p>
<p>In this article we are going to optimise <code class="verbatim">org-agenda</code> back to less than 1 second by dynamically building <code class="verbatim">org-agenda-files</code> list to include only files with <code class="verbatim">TODO</code> entries. All thanks to the power of <code class="verbatim">org-roam</code> and some hooks I am going to describe.</p>

      <p>In the <a href="https://d12frosted.io/posts/2020-06-23-task-management-with-roam-vol1.html">previous article</a> we set a ground for moving tasks to <a href="https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam">org-roam</a>, and encountered an issue with visual garbage in the agenda buffer. Namely, <code class="verbatim">org-roam</code> file id as part of the category. In this article, we are going to explore the means to overcome this issue.</p>

      <p><a href="https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam">Org-roam</a> is a note-taking tool built on top of Emacs and Org. Essentially, it’s a replica of <a href="https://roamresearch.com">Roam Research</a>. These tools provide an easy way to create and manage non-hierarchical notes. If you wish to learn more, just take a look at the <a href="https://org-roam.github.io/org-roam/manual/">Org-roam manual</a> or watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg61ocfxk3c">Making Connections in your Notes</a> video by Matt Williams. Believe me, Org-roam and Roam Research are game-changers. Or even better, don’t believe me and validate my claim by yourself.</p>
<p>Since I am already <a href="https://d12frosted.io/posts/2016-12-20-Being-an-org-mode-addict.html">addicted</a>, it was only natural to prefer <code class="verbatim">org-roam</code> over some web application. Apart from being developed on top of mature Org ecosystem, Emacs brings many merits and extensibility is one of them. Once <code class="verbatim">org-roam</code> introduced tags system in <a href="https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#111-18-05-2020">v1.1.1</a> I felt the lack of functions to manage them. Adding and removing them by hand is not nice. So in this article I am sharing a snippet that I’ve forged to ease the unbearable lightness of being.</p>

      <p>In stocks Emacs there is a function <code class="verbatim">move-to-beginning-of-line</code> which is bound to <code class="verbatim">C-a</code> by default. It does exactly what its name implies - moves the cursor to the beginning of line. In case of indented code this is usually not what I want, but instead I would love to move the first visible character of line.</p>
<div class="post-image post-image-half">
<img src="../images/beginning-of-line-haskell.gif" />

<p>There are packages that does this and even more (for example, <a href="https://github.com/alezost/mwim.el">mwim</a>), but if for some reason you don’t want to add one more package to your dependencies, or you care only about moving to the beginning of line, then you might grab the code that I share in the details. There is a version that also knows how to work with org mode headers and lists.</p>

      <p>Not everyone knows, but emacs-plus is almost an April Fool’s joke that was late for 1 day. Its <a href="https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus/commit/6c85ae34d2649512a3088207b5f2a81c23cd8630">initial release</a> was on 2nd April 2016 and the only feature it had compared to the official Emacs formula back in the day was Spacemacs icon (installed by default). Homebrew maintainers didn’t want to increase the complexity of the Emacs formula, so I’ve put that burden on myself, created a tap with one additional icon and after several years info command for <code class="verbatim">emacs-plus</code> prints a wall of options.</p>
<p>I am very happy to see so many users of this feature-inclusive (and sometimes experimental) formula. I am grateful to all of you. I would’ve abandoned this project a year ago if it would not you! And I think it’s fair to (in)formally share the current state of the project and shed some light on my plans.</p>

      <p>Ironically, I find the <a href="https://github.com/Wilfred/helpful">helpful</a> package quite helpful. It boosts Emacs <strong>help</strong> buffer with much more contextual information. If you haven’t tried it out yet, I advice you to do so.</p>
<p>However, by default, it doesn’t play nicely with windows.</p>
<p>Usually when I write some Elisp and I want to read the documentation of some function or variable, I hit <code>C-h f</code> or <code>C-h v</code> respectively and the help buffer is shown in the separate window. Which is convenient in my opinion, because I can see the code and the help.</p>
<p>Sometimes help contains links to other entries that I need to navigate. And when I hit <code>&lt;RET&gt;</code> window containing code shows another help buffer. Which might be good for some people, but I hate this behaviour, because usually I want to see the code that I am editing.</p>
<p>This is also annoying if you set the value of <code>helpful-max-buffers</code> to <code>1</code>. Help window and the window with code are swapped on every navigation.</p>
<p>The good thing, it’s configurable (as almost everything in Emacs land).</p>

      <h3><a href="../posts/2018-10-14-equality-of-booleans-in-emacs.html">Equality of booleans in Emacs</a></h3>

</div>

<p>There is a fun story about booleans in Emacs Lisp - there are no booleans in Emacs Lisp. Sort of. Because we have a symbol <code class="verbatim">nil</code>, which means an empty list. You can write it as <code class="verbatim">nil</code> or <code class="verbatim">()</code> - they both stand for the same object, the symbol <code class="verbatim">nil</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" data-org-language="emacs-lisp"><pre class="sourceCode commonlisp"><code class="sourceCode commonlisp"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>(<span class="kw">eq</span> <span class="kw">nil</span> ())                             <span class="co">; =&gt; t</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Since LISP is all about list processing, empty list is something very <code class="verbatim">false</code>. So <code class="verbatim">false</code> that we don’t have special symbol for <code class="verbatim">false</code> values, as empty list serves this purpose well.</p>
<p>Everything that is not an empty list has a meaning of <code class="verbatim">true</code>. However, there is a symbol <code class="verbatim">t</code> which is the preferred way to represent the truth value <code class="verbatim">true</code>.</p>
<p>So <code class="verbatim">nil</code> and <code class="verbatim">t</code> are considered canonical boolean values. There is a function <code class="verbatim">booleanp</code> that returns <code class="verbatim">t</code> if the argument is a canonical boolean value and <code class="verbatim">nil</code> otherwise.</p>
<p>The fun begins when you need to check if two boolean values are equal. Since non-nil (or not an empty list) can mean many different things (like <code class="verbatim">"Emacs is
the only true editor"</code>) you can’t just do regular equality check.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" data-org-language="emacs-lisp"><pre class="sourceCode commonlisp"><code class="sourceCode commonlisp"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>(<span class="kw">equal</span> <span class="kw">t</span> <span class="st">&quot;Emacs is the only true editor&quot;</span>) <span class="co">; =&gt; nil</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are, however, several tricks to get it working. The most obvious solution is to convert value to a canonical boolean value.</p>

      <p>Anyone would agree that typing <code class="verbatim">#+BEGIN_SRC ... #+END_SRC</code> blocks manually feels <strong>strange</strong>.</p>
<p>In order to make life easier, some people implement helpers to insert these blocks.

Other people use <a href="https://github.com/mineo/yatemplate">yatemplate</a> to create generic or specific templates for blocks.</p>
<p>But what is most fascinating, is that <code class="verbatim">org-mode</code> bundles with templates for some structural elements like these blocks.

<p>It is funny how I vainly try to escape devilish <code>org-mode</code>. I have several major concerns regarding it as a GTD system and a note taking system, but after all, whatever I try to replace it with, I always return to <code>org-mode</code>. Mostly because it’s simple (at least at the top level) and makes me feel more confident about my thoughts, tasks and the future. But on the other hand, it makes me really angry because it forces me to make some uncomfortable decisions.</p>

<p>Not long ago I have released the first version of <code>flyspell-correct</code>. There are several interesting changes compared to initial implementation. First of all, I divided this package into four different packages - core and interfaces. This allowed me to properly setup dependencies and also solved some problems with <code class="verbatim">helm</code> interface. Second important change - I’ve added a function called <code>flyspell-correct-previous-word-generic</code>, which is useful when the misspelled word is not under point, but long behind it. Right now I realise that it doesn’t work as perfect as I want, so I’ll improve it in the next release.</p>

      <p>It’s not a secret that I enjoy using Emacs. And people often ask me why it’s Emacs and not Vi(m). The top issue for me is the modal editing thing. Somehow I just don’t get it. I understand that some people are able to fully utilize this feature, but I can’t say that about myself. In any case, recently I was reading an <a href="http://irreal.org/blog/?p=5237">article on Irreal</a> about Vim being not that hard to learn compared to Emacs and found a link to another interesting <a href="https://medium.com/@mkozlows/why-atom-cant-replace-vim-433852f4b4d1#.rqcouk4l1">article about composability of Vim</a>.</p>
<p>I totally agree that composability is a great feature that unfortunately wasn’t widely adopted. It’s very powerful in use and great in terms of learnability and consistency. Just as Mike Kozlowski has stated. I don’t want to repeat his article, instead just go ahead and read it.</p>
<p>What I want to do is to defend Emacs (and some other editors). I really think that it was very smart move to place the stake on the ability to extend the editor. And Emacs is a great example of such editor. Just take a look at <code>evil</code>. Whenever I think about it, I am amazed. It doesn’t mean that I want to use it, it just shows that extensibility matters and its limits are very loose.</p>
<p>Let’s return to composability in Emacs. One might argue that Emacs comes with built-in composability, but let’s be honest even if it’s not true - it’s still <a href="https://github.com/paldepind/composable.el">easy to implement</a> vim-like composability even in Emacs. It’s just a matter of effort.</p>
<p>To follow Mike Kozlowski’s trend, I admit that Emacs is not perfect. Some people don’t like Emacs Lisp, and out-of-box experience is far from being ideal. In order to perfect Emacs The Editor you have to invest a lot of time in writing configurations. You also have to use dozens of third-party packages and also configure them appropriately. But it gives you freedom. And in case you don’t like writing configs, just take a look at these great projects - <a href="https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d">Purcell’s emacs.d</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">Prelude</a> and of course, <a href="https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs">Spacemacs.</a> You have plenty of options. And composability is one of them.</p>

      <p><code>flyspell-correct</code> is a package for distraction-free words correction with flyspell via selected interface. It’s available on <a href="https://github.com/d12frosted/flyspell-correct">GitHub</a> and <a href="http://melpa.org/#/flyspell-correct">MELPA</a>.</p>
<p>It’s very common to make mistakes while writing notes, comments or whatever. And a desire to have spell checking software is natural. In <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/index.html">Emacs</a>, we usually use <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FlySpell">Flyspell</a> for that purpose. It’s a great piece of software, but sometimes it lacks better interface for correcting words. Especially since there are completion packages like <a href="https://github.com/auto-complete/popup-el">popup.el</a>, <a href="https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm">helm</a>, <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper">ivy</a> etc. There are already available separate packages for correcting words via <code>popup.el</code> (<a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FlySpell#toc11">wiki</a>, <a href="https://github.com/xuchunyang/flyspell-popup">flyspell-popup</a>) and <code>helm</code> (<a href="https://github.com/pronobis/helm-flyspell">helm-flyspell</a>). Since recently I have switched from <code>helm</code> to <code>ivy</code>, I’ve found a lack of similar package for <code>ivy</code>, so I decided to write my own.</p>
<p>But available packages are all the same, except the part that calls completion front-end, so my goal was to provide a generic package allowing usage of any interface. Either from the predefined set (<code>ivy</code>, <code>helm</code>, <code>popup</code> or <code>dummy</code>) or any user-defined.</p>
