      <p>During migration to <code class="verbatim">nix</code> for package and system management in <a href="https://github.com/d12frosted/environment/pull/11">environment#11</a>, I’ve encountered an issue with <code class="verbatim">PATH</code> variable containing seemingly correct entries, but in incorrect order when using <code class="verbatim">fish</code>. Basically, <code class="verbatim">$HOME/.nix-profile/bin</code> is put in the end. Since I am very new to <code class="verbatim">nix</code> ecosystem (using it for few days), it was not clear what is causing this issue (my configuration, <code class="verbatim">nix-home-manager</code>, <code class="verbatim">nix-darwin</code> or <code class="verbatim">fish</code> itself), so I decided to investigate. While it turned out to be a <a href="https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin/issues/122">known issue</a>, I learned a little bit in the process and found a local fix, which I am sharing in the end of the post.</p>

<p>Have you ever been in a situation when you called <code class="verbatim">git fetch</code>, stared at the screen for several seconds and then switched to the browser to read something ‘useful’ while <code class="verbatim">git</code> fetches updates? And in five minutes you’re like ‘Oh wait, I was doing something important, no?’. Rings the bell, doesn’t it?</p>

      <p>I have always been inspired by the people who use (or at least can use) terminal for any kind of activity that is associated with programming. Sure, every task has its own set of instruments to be solved with. But there are instruments that you can count on in almost any situation. That’s why I spend so much time in the terminal.</p>
<p>For a long time (like a year and a half) I was using <code>zsh</code> beefed with <code>oh-my-zsh</code>. While it was providing me a lot of crucial functionality, I wasn’t very happy about <code>oh-my-zsh</code>, so when someone mentioned <code>fish</code> in comments to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/2u6b8m/use_haskell_for_shell_scripting/">Use Haskell for shell scripting</a> thread on Reddit, I decided to give it a try after few minutes of reading how awesome <code>fish</code> is.</p>
<p>In this article I am going to share my thoughts after using <code>fish</code>. But keep in mind that this is not a tutorial to <code>fish</code> (mostly because it already has a good written <a href="http://fishshell.com/docs/current/tutorial.html">one</a>, which covers most important aspects of day-to-day <code>fish</code>, but you might also want to read full <a href="http://fishshell.com/docs/current/index.html">documentation</a> to get the full grasp).</p>
<p>Exploring new stuff is fun. So even if you are totally happy with your setup, I highly advice you to take a look at <code>fish</code>.</p>
